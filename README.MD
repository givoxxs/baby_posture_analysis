## üìã Overview

A sophisticated system for analyzing baby posture in images to detect potential safety risks during sleep. This project uses computer vision and machine learning to identify potentially dangerous sleeping positions and provide recommendations for safer baby sleep practices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Image Analysis**: Process and enhance images for optimal pose detection
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Skeletal keypoint detection with 3D coordinates
- **ML-Powered Risk Assessment**: Evaluate baby sleeping positions for safety concerns
- **Detailed Analysis Reports**: Get comprehensive insights on posture risks
- **API-First Design**: RESTful endpoints for easy integration with other systems
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Simple visual testing of the analysis system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture:

### 1. Image Preprocessing Module

- Image normalization and enhancement
- Noise reduction and filtering
- Dimension standardization
- Quality optimization for pose detection

### 2. Keypoint Extraction Module

- MediaPipe Pose for skeletal keypoint detection
- 33 standard body keypoints with 3D coordinates (x, y, z)
- Confidence scores for reliable pose estimation
- Visibility metrics for each detected keypoint

### 3. Posture Feature Construction Module

- Head-torso angle detection for sleeping position
- Limb angle calculations for unnatural positions
- Blanket coverage detection
- Face-down position detection (higher risk factor)

### 4. Risk Analysis Module

- Comprehensive assessment of sleeping position safety
- Risk scoring system (1-10 scale)
- Detailed reasoning for risk assessment
- Specific recommendations based on identified risks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework
- **MediaPipe**: Google's ML solution for pose estimation
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision for image processing
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image handling and processing

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/baby_posture_analysis.git
   cd baby_posture_analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment configuration**:
   Create an `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   API_HOST=0.0.0.0
   API_PORT=8000
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Starting the Server

1. **Run the API server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   Or simply use:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API documentation**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```
   This provides interactive Swagger UI documentation for testing all API endpoints.

3. **Test with the web interface**:
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   The simple web interface allows you to upload images and visualize the analysis results.
